Here you can find examples for using the ourcord library

> Note: the dotenv library comes in pre-packaged and automatically runs config. This will init any .env files you have for use

## JS <a href="https://github.com/ourcord/examples/blob/main/js/index.js#L1"></></a>

This index file goes through the basics of setting up the client (in CommonJS).  
More examples will be added in the future (embeds, extending the client, etc).

## TS <a href="https://github.com/ourcord/examples/blob/main/ts/index.ts#L1"></></a>

This index file is functionally the same as the js one but written in typescript.  
You will have to transpile it with tsc (and have typescript installed).  
You can use the [attached tsconfig file](https://github.com/ourcord/ourcord/blob/master/tsconfig.json) as a boilerplate to build off of and add to.
